Salutations, good sir

You have some balls to read my README.md. While it may not contain any special information about myself (because that doesn't actually matter on a site where everyone's one skill is constant depression and programming), It will contain about a million private repositories that you will never see, and nor will I. 

Despite me saying that I would refuse to provide any social context around my life, I will comunicate a few pieces of technology that I have become accustomed to using (another word for "political oppinions"):

1) C#
2) Unity
3) Flutter/Dart
4) A slither of JavaScript and Python

Do I have any proof?

Pft.... of course I don't

I'm not that creative. I feed of other's thoughts and convert them into real life. My current project involves this very idea. I am simply copying and pasting my friends idea about a 2d game into unity, and refusing to take any compliments about being "talented," because really, I'm not. 

Despite this, I still have one fo the greatest egos you'll ever find; I somehow have the audacity to help people on r/Unity3D, and the Unity forums, despite my lack of understanding of the Unity engine just to populate my agressive need to expand said ego. 

Anyway, now that I have finished emabarassing myself in one of the cringiest, bios I ahve ever written, you can now continue to live as a human. 

Thanks,

Diseased Finger.

PS: Don't do VCE, please. Please don't.
